# KABot Trading Bot

This repository contains a cryptocurrency and stock trading bot driven by sentiment signals from Reddit posts and simple technical indicators. It supports both live and mock trading via Kraken and Alpaca APIs.

## Project Structure

The core application now lives in the `ka_bot` package:

```
ka_bot/
    config.py
    main.py
    clients/
        alpaca_rest_client.py
        alpaca_ws_client.py
        kraken_rest_client.py
        kraken_ws_client.py
        reddit_client.py
    services/
        sentiment_engine.py
        technical_analyzer.py
        risk_manager.py
        asset_discoverer.py
        mock_trader.py
    db/
        database.py
    analysis/
        ai_sentiment_analyzer.py
    dashboard/
        dashboard.py
        dashboard_utils.py
```

Run the bot with:

```bash
python -m ka_bot.main
```

## Micro Trading Enhancements

This update introduces a basic volatility measure and improved risk management for micro trading:

- **Volatility Tracking**: The technical analyzer now calculates shortâ€‘term price volatility based on percentage returns of the last 20 data points.
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: The risk manager reduces trade size when volatility exceeds `Config.VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD`.

These additions help the bot adapt position sizes to market conditions when executing very small, frequent trades.

## Financial News Scanning

The bot now includes a simple RSS-based news client that pulls headlines from
popular outlets such as MarketWatch and Yahoo Finance. New articles are scanned
for ticker symbols and fed into the asset discovery pipeline so that trending
stocks can be monitored automatically.

## Backtesting

The `Backtester` class in `analysis/backtester.py` provides a simple way to test
trading ideas against a year's worth of historical data downloaded with
`yfinance`. Pass in a strategy function that returns `"buy"` or `"sell"` signals
and the backtester will simulate trades and report the final portfolio value.
